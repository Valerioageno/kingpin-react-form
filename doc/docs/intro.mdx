## In few lines

Kingpin is a form library that aims to make the writing of forms on React easy like writing them directly
on a HTML file.

To do it Kingpin lets each input to be just declared and respecting the [Single
Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
of each element (each input field take care just of it self).

The SRP lets each field to render independently without causing unhandled re-render side effects.

The main `<Form />` component is the **only** interface for managing user set data, this choice in order to
lead to a better forms develop and managing all the data in a single place (each state could be listened with the
still available `onChange` element event).

Read more in the [documentation](https://kingpin-react-form.vercel.app/docs/intro).

## Why a new form library?

Currently implementations are quite verbose causing a confusing DX and in
some case they use uncontrolled components which is the
[unrecommended](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)
way to handle forms in React.

In most cases using uncontrolled components causes re-renders in unexpected
actions like during the submit (?).

Among the other reasons Kingpin wants to let the developer to write forms in the
better React way possible handling the re-renders in a declarative way.

## How hard is writing Kingpin's forms?

In short... easy like a pie.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```tsx
import { Form, Input, Value } from 'kingpin-react-form'
import { FormEvent } from 'react'

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit}>
      <Input name="email" type="email" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="password" type="password" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="terms-acceptance" type="checkbox" initialValue={true} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```jsx
import { Form, Input } from 'kingpin-react-form'

function App() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit}>
      <Input name="email" type="email" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="password" type="password" initialValue="" />
      <Input name="terms-acceptance" type="checkbox" initialValue={true} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Key concept

In order to make Kingpin efficient and reusable the entire state logic is managed
within the `<Form />` component (you shouldn't directly control each input value).

Each Kingpin action element (`<Input />`, `<Textarea />`, ...) has two mandatory fields:

- name (string describing the input purpose; be aware of possible name conflicts!)
- initialValue (That's it)

Thanks to them the `<Form />` is now able to easily handle the internal state, but how?

`<Form />` is "**just**" a simple html `<form>`, so you can use it as usual. The most important
difference is that the `onSubmit` event now takes two arguments: the "classic"
[event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubmitEvent) and an object
which is the `name:value` representation of its content.
